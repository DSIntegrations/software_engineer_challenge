# Tech Challenge: Todo List Application Backend

## Objective üöÄ
Create a GitHub repository containing a Todo List application backend using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and SQL. Implement RESTful API endpoints adhering to SOLID principles for better code organization and maintainability.

## Tasks üìù

### 1. Setup Project Structure
- Initialize a new Node.js project.
- Set up TypeScript for the project. (you can use only Javascript but cool to see your code with node)

### 2. Implement Todo List API
- Create CRUD endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for managing Todo items.
- Use Express.js for routing.
- Use TypeScript for type safety where applicable. (if you want to use Typecript)

### 3. Database Integration
- Set up a SQL database (SQLite or any other SQL database).
- Create a database schema for storing Todo items.
- Implement database operations (queries) for CRUD operations.
- or just mock the data in a .json file or some vector. The solution depends of you and your time

### 4. Apply SOLID Principles (nice to have, depends of you)
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each class/function has a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Design modules that are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Ensure objects of a superclass are replaceable with objects of its subclasses.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

### 5. Testing (Optional but Recommended)
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints and database operations using a testing framework like Jest.

### 6. Documentation and README (nive to have, depends of you)
- Include a `README.md` file that explains:
  - Project overview and functionality.
  - Instructions for setting up and running the project locally.
  - API endpoints documentation (using tools like Swagger or simple markdown).
  - Any additional information or considerations.

### 7. GitHub Repository
- Create a public GitHub repository.
- Commit your code with meaningful commit messages.
- Push your local repository to GitHub.

## Bonus (Optional) üåü , It should be a good excercise for you. Think about it
- Implement authentication (e.g., JWT) for API endpoints.
- Add frontend (using React, Vue, etc.) to interact with the Todo List API.

## Submission üì¨
Share the GitHub repository link containing your Todo List application backend.

This challenge is designed to assess your knowledge and skills in JavaScript/TypeScript, APIs, SOLID principles, SQL databases, and GitHub repository management. Let's build something awesome! üéâ
